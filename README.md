# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to compare key metrics and categories of data between three types of city types that our organzation services. We wanted to understand the key differences and finally arrive at some recommendations. The time period of the data is over the first 4 calendar months of the year 2019.
## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
As a summary of the key metics, the following table shows our key metrics around overall rides, drivers, and the share the driver takes by three city types. This was broken into Rural, Suburban, and Urban.
### Overall Key Metrics by City Type

It seems consistent with what we traditionally think of population size (Rural = low, Suburban = medium, and Urban = high) that we would also see a total share broken by type of number of rides and total cost of the rides accordingly. However, with large population, there is a significant difference between the amount a driver can make individually and the cost of the ride. There is a lot of compeition amongst drivers in the Urban category. 
### Fares by Week by City Type
Below is a rolled up summary of each week and the total fare for that week for the first 4 months of the year. As in the above there is a differentiate by type as different tiers. However, there are some key results to call out.

As you can see above, there is more variation among the Urban type especially as the Spring as ramped up. Rural and Suburban seem to be relatively stable.

# Summary:
Given the differences between the types of cities, there are few recommendations that we will make here that will focus by type.
## Recommendation for Urban Cities:
One of the biggest focus areas should be in the type of city with the opportunity for growth. There are currently almost twice as many drivers as riders in the market. Opportunities would be to look deeper into areas that are underpenetrated and have a 1:1 driver to rider ratio. While more highly variable, there is growth in the Urban cities from January to April. As the Spring opens up and customers are getting out to more events, there needs to be a stronger advertising push to get to volume to the drivers.
## Recommendation for Suburban Cities:
Suburban market has a strong balance between amount of fares, fare per ride, and fare per driver. Meaning that there is a good relationship of ratio to market and driver earning potential. Distances are longer so there also needs to be focus on growth. Our recommendation is to look for cities of Urban/Suburban relationship that may give the larger quanity of drivers in the Urban cities some opportunity to earn more if they would be willing to come out to Suburban areas on off-peak areas.
## Recommendation for Rural Cities:
The Rural market is going to have a lower population so there is an upper limit of rides to drivers. However, there may be an opportunity for the driver to be able to optimize more routes to give up some extra customers on similar routes. Rural may also benefit into looking at generating other types of rides such as hauling material or packages over significant distances as a service.
